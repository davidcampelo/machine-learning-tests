# Machine learning with Python

In this repository I aim to share all my studies on machine learning using Python on MAC OS. 

There are some requirements to run these notebooks locally:

* [Python3 machine learning environment](https://machinelearningmastery.com/install-python-3-environment-mac-os-x-machine-learning-deep-learning/)
* [XGBoost for Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/install-xgboost-python-macos/)
